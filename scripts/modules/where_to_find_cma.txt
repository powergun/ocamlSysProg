# 

# firstly, install ocamlfind and refresh the environment:
opam install ocamlfind
eval $(opam env)

# then test that ocamlfind is working:
ocamlfind list

# follow the above link, for example, to find the str.cma I can:
ocamlfind query str
ls $(ocamlfind query str)/*.cma

# 1st line: I get the module name "str" from `ocamlfind list`
# 2nd line: this is to ensure that str.cma is in the search path and that file exists

# once confirmed, I can call 

#load "str.cma";;
